# Data

This project uses historical daily price data for the NIFTY 50 index.
Data is downloaded programmatically using the yfinance library.

Raw datasets are not stored in the repository to keep it lightweight
and fully reproducible.

The goal of this project is not to beat the market, but to build a realistic, reproducible ML pipeline and understand how small predictive edges behave in noisy financial data with an accuracy ranging between 55-60%
